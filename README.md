# SnakeGame
The snake game made in python using turtle.
Uses OOP concepts and slicing to decrease redundancy as well as decrease compile times and lastly, make the code look cleaner and more understandable. 
It consists of a scoreboard as well as colisions with walls and the tail of the snake.
A score board to keep track of your score and prevernts you from moving the opposite direction like the original snake game.
You can customise the color of each segment of the snake using the indexes in the "SNAKE_SEGMENTS" tuple.
You can also change the shape, size and color of the snake in the "snake" class
Adjust the screen resolution as well as hitboxes for the food, the walls as well as the snakes own body in the main file.
